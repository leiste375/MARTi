MARTi is a software package designed for performing real-time analysis of metagenomic samples using nanopore sequencing. If you're not working in real-time, MARTi may still be a quick and easy analysis solution for you. And if you're not using nanopore sequencing, you may still benefit from using MARTi to analyse your data.

You can try MARTi out at `http://marti.cyverseuk.org <http://marti.cyverseuk.org>`_.

MARTi runs on Linux and on macOS. At the moment, Windows is not supported.

.. Note::
   | The current version of MARTi is for beta testing purposes and the following are not yet fully implemented:
   | 
   | * Full SLURM support - you can run on an HPC (SLURM or otherwise), but you are restricted to the resources of the HPC node that the MARTi back-end runs on.
   | * Centrifuge support - currently only BLAST-based analysis is supported.
