SampleName	BAMBI_1D_18042017	Sample name
RawDataDir	/path/to/dir	Run directory - specifically the path to the directory containing the fastq_pass, fastq_fail etc. directories. Or for guppy run separately, the directory containing the fastq directory.
SampleDir	/path/to/dir	Path to directory to use for MARTi analysis files (will be created if doesn't exist)
ProcessBarcodes	01,02,03	If a barcoded sample, indicates which barcodes to process
BarcodeId<n>	BarcodeSampleId1	Sample ID to use for barcode n
Scheduler	local	Job scheduler to use - currently only "local" works. Soon will be able to specify "slurm" to run SLURM.
Queue	ei-medium	The default job submission queue. Currently only required for SLURM and equates to the partition name.
MaxJobs	4	Specifies the maximum number of concurrent jobs that can be run by the scheduler (local or SLURM).
InactivityTimeout	10	How long (seconds) before giving up waiting for new reads to appear. After this timeout, all remaining analysis will be completed and analysis will stop. Default timeout is 10 seconds.
StopProcessingAfter	50000	Stop analysis after this number of reads. Default behaviour is no limit.
TaxonomyDir	/path/to/dir	Specifies location of NCBI taxonomy files (i.e. the directory containing nodes.dmp and names.dmp).
AccessionMap	/path/to/file	Specifies an accession map for mapping accession IDs to taxa. This is generated using the NCBI accession2taxid data by a separte tool. Option should not be required for normal MARTi operation.
ConvertFastQ	n/a	Deprecated.
ReadsPerBlast	4000	BLAST chunk size - reads are batched into bundles of this number before BLASTing.
