MARTi is undergoing some final testing before we release the code to the world.

However, if you would like to get access to a test version before we release it, please email richard.leggett@earlham.ac.uk.
MARTi consists of two main components:

* a back-end which performs the analysis and can be a single desktop/laptop or a high performance cluster.
* a lightweight web-based front-end which allows users to view analysis results.
Back-end installation---------------------Coming soon.Front-end installation-----------------------------------------------Coming soon.
