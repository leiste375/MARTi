# MARTi
Metagenomic Analysis in Real Time

Documentation: https://marti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Try MARTi out at http://marti.cyverseuk.org

Current version is for beta testing purposes and the following are not yet fully implemented:

* Full SLURM support - you can run on an HPC (SLURM or otherwise), but you are restricted to the resources of the HPC node that the MARTi back-end runs on.
* Centrifuge support - currently only BLAST-based analysis is supported.

These features will appear soon.
